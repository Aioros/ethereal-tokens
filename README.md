# Ethereal Tokens
A module for Foundry VTT to allow specific tokens to ignore walls when moving.

## How to use
Once installed, you'll see a new option at the bottom of the token configuration window:

Any token with this checkbox enabled will be able to move through walls as if the "Unconstrained Movement" control button was active.
